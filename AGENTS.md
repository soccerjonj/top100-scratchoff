# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version (Next.js 16) has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

Notably: `params` and `searchParams` in App Router page components are now `Promise<...>` and must be `await`ed.
